# Overview

I plan on making my game like "Age of Mythology."
1. There will be villagers and warriors.
2. Move selected object. 3. Everyone will have health, attack and defense bar.
4. Villagers will have option to build house, armory etc.
5. Warriors will salvage lost items and fight with monsters. 
6. There will be trees, gold mine and food cultivation. 
7. Villagers will be tasked to gather food, gold, wood and store them at the town hall. 

# Problems

1. Visually represents eveything.
2. Assigning tasks to villagers so they can go back and forth to the food or gold ot tree to town hall.
