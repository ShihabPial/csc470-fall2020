# Plan for the game

This is a first person visual shooting game. Player has to walk around look for enemies and shoot to kill or be killed. A few bots will be moving around. When player gets in their range they start shooting. Each hit will decrease one's health. If the player hides for a while health will start to build up again slowly but there will be some objects, when collected health will increase immedialtely. This will be a two round game. Round one will be only bots. On round two after killing all the bots, player has to face the boss. The boss has greater health. There will be a few hiding places to avoid hit from the boss. The boss can only turn around all direction following the player but position will not change. 

Use W,A,S,D to move around, Space to jump, left Shift to run, right Mouse click to shoot, move mouse for direction. 

A nature music will play all the time. There will be shooting sound, a sound when the bots and the boss are destroyed and a victory sound. 


This is a sample Interface I got from Unity website. I will try to make it like this but exactly same. My gun and enemy and the place will be different.
