# Plan for the game

This is a first person visual shooting game. Player has to walk around look for enemies and shoot to kill or be killed. A few bots will be moving around. When player gets in their range they start shooting. Each hit will decrease one's health. If the player hides for a while health will start to build up again slowly but there will be some objects, when collected health will increase immedialtely. This will be a two round game. Round one will be only bots. On round two after killing all the bots, player has to face the boss. The boss has greater health. There will be a few hiding places to avoid hit from the boss. The boss can only turn around all direction following the player but position will not change. 

Use W,A,S,D to move around, Space to jump, left Shift to run, right Mouse click to shoot, move mouse for direction. 

A nature music will play all the time. There will be shooting sound, a sound when the bots and the boss are destroyed and a victory sound. 


This is a sample Interface I got from Unity website. I will try to make it like this but not exactly same. My gun, enemy and the place will be different.

## Three set targets 
### Low bar
One round of game. Kill the bots and the boss to win the game. Only shooting sound will be available. Movement will be as planned. Have a health regeneration point.
### Target
Definitely, complete the low bar. Add all kinds of sound described in the plan. Add a few hiding place. 
### High Bar
Complete the target. Add a navigation bar on top to see where are all the bots and the boss. Have a task bar to see what is the player supposed to do. Gun reloading once run out of bullets or plasma. m Adding crouch and prone.

## Timeline 
Originally I plan to finish my **Low bar** by this Sunday. During office hour get the necessary help. There are a few things I want to try out; like bots will shoot only if I get in their range. If low bar is successfully done I will work my way to the **Target bar**. SO, I have one week for **low bar** and the next week for **target bar**. If i still have time try to manage **high bar**. 

# Actual Game
This is a first person game called "Treasure Hunt". There are some bots guarding an ancient treasure in a forest. To get to the treasure hero has to kill all the bots. Otherwise the treasure will not show up. Once the bots sees you they will always follow you. They have the ability to shoot in sight. But the you have a hiding place. If you can get inside of it you are safe and health will regenerate. 
A welcome message comes in as you entre the forest or to say start the game. 

Main control units are WASD and mouse looks. Shoots with right mouse click. Canvas is your health bar. As you get hit it will go red. If you die you lose.
